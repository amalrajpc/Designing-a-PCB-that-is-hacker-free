# Designing-a-PCB-that-is-hacker-free
Designing a hacker-resistant Printed Circuit Board (PCB) helps to  prevent unauthorized access or manipulation/ tampering.
Still, a single step won't be enough to stop a determined hacker from breaking into a PCB design.
From PCB design to assembly, there are several strategies that designers can implement to create secure  PCBs that are resistant to PCB hacking.

## Verify that descriptive silkscreens are removed from PCBs
The descriptive silkscreen that displays information relating to debugging are present in the  majority of production PCBs.
Remove debuggable header from production PCBs. 
Removing extraneous information from the PCB assembly and designing process will prevents hackers from getting the information they need.
## Verify that debug paths and traces are depopulated from production PCBs
## Use compotents withouts leads
## Remove test points
## Minimize the risk of side channel attack
