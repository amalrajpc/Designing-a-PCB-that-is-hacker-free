A side-channel attack (SCA) is a security exploit that attempts to extract secrets from a chip or a system. 
This can be achieved by measuring or analyzing various physical parameters. 
Examples include supply current, execution time, and electromagnetic emission.
Use a microcontroller that emits less electromagnetic radiation.
Seperate the sesitive traces away from the noisey signal lines.
